Interactive TUI for selecting and packing repository files into an AI-friendly prompt.

RepoPacker provides a terminal-based user interface to navigate your project, select specific files
and directories, and then generate a consolidated text block. This block includes the content of the
selected files, formatted for easy input into large language models (LLMs) or for archival purposes.
It respects `.gitignore` rules and offers additional filtering capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features (Planned/Included)

*   Interactive file tree navigation.
*   Selection of multiple files and directories.
*   Respects `.gitignore` files and custom ignore patterns.
*   Filters out binary files and overly large files.
*   Copies the packed output to the system clipboard.
*   Recent project history.
*   Customizable output format (currently XML-like).
*   Keyboard-driven interface.
