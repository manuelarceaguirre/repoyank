# Welcome to RepoPacker Documentation

RepoPacker is an interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface) application designed to help you select and pack files from a repository into a single, AI-friendly prompt. This is particularly useful for preparing context for Large Language Models (LLMs), code analysis, or creating archives of specific project components.

## Project Goals

*   Provide an intuitive and efficient way to select files from a project.
*   Generate a structured output that is easy for AI models to parse.
*   Respect project configurations like `.gitignore`.
*   Offer customization for advanced users.
